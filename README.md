# Rovot


# OBJECTIVE

The purpose of this test is to enable you to demonstrate your proficiency in solving problems

using software engineering tools and processes. Read the specification below and produce a solution. Your solution should be in the form of completed code.

The problem specified below requires a solution that receives input, does some processing and

then returns some output. You are free to implement any mechanism for feeding input into your

solution. You should provide sufficient evidence that your solution is complete by, as a minimum,

indicating that it works correctly against the supplied test data. Using a unit testing framework

would satisfy these requirements.

The interviewer will be interested in:

* Your ability to read and interpret the specification below.

* The architectural design of your solution.

* The readability of your code.

* Your overall approach to this exercise.

# SPECIFICATION

A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars. The navigation team needs a utility for them to simulate rover movements so they can develop a navigation plan.

A rover's position is represented by a combination of an x and y co-ordinates and a letter

representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to

simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottom

left corner and facing North.

In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are:

* 'L' â€“ Make the rover spin 90 degrees left without moving from its current spot

* 'R' - Make the rover spin 90 degrees right without moving from its current spot

* 'M'. Move forward one grid point, and maintain the same heading.

Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).

# INPUT

The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the plateau, the lower-left coordinates are

assumed to be 0,0.

The rest of the input is information pertaining to the rovers that have been deployed. Each rover

has two lines of input. The first line gives the rover's position, and the second line is a series of

instructions telling the rover how to explore the plateau.

The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the x

and y co-ordinates and the rover's orientation.

Each rover will be finished sequentially, which means that the second rover won't start to move until the first one has finished moving.



# OUTPUT

The output for each rover should be its final co-ordinates and heading.
